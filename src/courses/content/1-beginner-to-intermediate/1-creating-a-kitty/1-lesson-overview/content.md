# Lesson Overview

In Chapter 1, you're going to build a "Kitty Creator" to bring a bunch of Kitties to life.

- Our creator will maintain a database of all Kitties that are created.
- Our creator will have a function for creating new Kitties
- Each Kitty will have a name and a random appearence

In later lessons, we'll add more functionality, like giving Kitties the ability to attack each other! But before we get there, we have to add the basic functionality of creating new Kitties.

### Put it to the test

1. Add a name to the Kitty on the right and then input a bunch of random numbers for its DNA. You should see the Kitty changing based on the number you input!

Ok, enough playing around. When you're ready to continue, hit "1.2 Contracts" on the left, and let's dive into learning Cadence!
