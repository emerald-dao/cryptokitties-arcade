# Contracts

Starting with the absolute basics:

Cadence's code is encapsulated in contracts, transactions, and scripts. A contract is the fundamental building block of Flow applications â€” all variables and functions belong to a contract, and this will be the starting point of all your projects.

We will cover transactions and scripts later.

An empty contract named `HelloWorld` would look like this:

```swift
access(all) contract HelloWorld {

    // run only once when the
    // contract is deployed
    init() {

    }
}
```

# Put it to the test
